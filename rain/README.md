# Rain - Water Retention Problem

This project provides a Python function to calculate how much water will be retained after it rains, given a list of wall heights.

## Description

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the elevation of walls, the `rain` function computes the total amount of water that would be trapped between the walls after rainfall.

## Usage

1. Place your wall heights in a Python list.
2. Import and call the `rain` function with your list.

## Example

```python
from 0-rain import rain

walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
print(rain(walls))  # Output: 6
```
